### **About Me**
___
Dr. Saeed Mojtabazadeh is the pioneering geotechnical engineering postdoctoral researcher in Iran, specializing in computational algorithms. Since 2016, Dr. Mojtabazadeh has been dedicated to advanced numerical modeling in seismic geomechanics. His Ph.D. thesis and postdoctoral research focus on investigating SH-wave propagation in orthotropic mediums, along with topographic features, utilizing an exclusive approach known as the Direct Half-Space Time-Domain Boundary Element Method. He has developed multiple numerical approaches, including the Boundary Element Method (BEM), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Hybrid methods, applied to seismic analysis in geotechnical engineering.
