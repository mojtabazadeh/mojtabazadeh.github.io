### About Me
___
I am an Assistant Professor of [Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.html) at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu). Prior to joining Kelley, I spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu). I received my Ph.D. in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the [University of Michigan](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu). Previously, I obtained an M.A. in Statistics from the University of Michigan. 

I am interested in data-driven analytics to solve a wide range of problems in healthcare, service operations, and public policy.
